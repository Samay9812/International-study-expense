5. Miscellaneous

6. Earnings across the 2-year period (part-time work, internships, etc.)

7. Parental Support: Total money sent by parents

8.Expected vs Actual Spending: DAX logic used to calculate and compare planned budget vs real expenses

📈 Visuals & Reports:
1. Donut Chart showing percentage-wise spending by expense type

2. Line Chart 1: Monthly spending trend
